<h1>What is Vector</h1>

Vector Is a webapp I am developing as a course project. Vector is a Todo list and note-taking webapp. Vector will allow the creation of todo lists where tasks can be seperated into sections and given tags along with other features. 
Vector will also allow the user to take notes which can also be attached to todo lists.

<h2>Status</h2>

Vector is a project which I just started on and is very early in development. Little has been done so far and much of the project needs to be planed.

<h2>Features</h2>
My planned features aren't set in stone yet and are subject to change but as of now these are what I plan to do.
<h3>Todo List</h3>
- Creation of tasks and sections to organize tasks.
- Tags to be applied to Tasks and sections.
- Notes, comments, and descriptions can be put on tasks and sections.

<h3>Notes</h3>
- Create and save Notes.
- Notes can be standalone or be a part of todo lists.
- (Possible) Multiple supported file types such as markdown rather than just txt.
